# Contribute to the We Build Black Algorithms group!
This repo and these events are curated, crafted, and cared for by coders like you. We are actively looking for new contributors who identify as women, trans, or genderqueer, who can help share their knowledge of programming with others. If this sounds like you, read on!

## Things we LOVE:
* `New problems!` They should be language agnostic, vary widely in difficulty, and should take between 5-20 minutes to complete. We will have a weekly algorithm. If you submit a problem, please consider submitting one solution as well in either pseudo code or the language of your choice. 
* `New solutions!` We accept all levels of optimization and all languages. Consider adding tests for bonus points :)
* `New tests!` Add tests to solutions you submit or existing solutions in a *testing* folder within the *solutions* folder. Please update the README.md within the testing folder on how to set it up and run the test(s).
* `Free resources!` They go in our [main readme](./README.md)

## Contributing Problems and Solutions to the Repo!
Checkout our latest and greatest **[GitGuide](./gitGuide.md)** to walk you through submitting your first pull request with your contribution!
Take note! At the moment we generally structure and namespace our files like so:
```
├── Algorithms (top folder)
	├── gitGuide.md
	├── howToContribute.md
	├── Day-Month-Year.md (date of current weekly algorithm, markdown file with links to problems)
	├── pastEvents (folder)
		├── Day-Month-Year.md (date of past weekly algorithms, markdown files with links to old problems)
	├── challenges (folder)
		├── NameOfProblem (folder)
			├── NameOfProblem.md (markdown file with description of the problem)
			├── solutions (folder)
				├── NameOfProblem.js (solutions files in various languages)
				├── NameOfProblem.py
				├── NameOfProblem.rb 
				├── testing (folder)
					├──(any testing files you may need!)

```
It'd be cool if you can do the same. But if not we will work with what we got.

## New to git?
Git and GitHub allow us to collaborate on projects without ever worrying about losing our work (or our minds). Think google docs but with better version control.

To get started here are a few free tutorials/readings:
* [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
* [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Git for Beginners](http://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/)
* [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide)

And of course feel free to ask for help!
