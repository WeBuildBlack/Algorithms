# Distnt Barcodes

## Problem

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the `i`-th barcode is `barcodes[i]`.

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.

## Example 1

```
Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]
```

## Example 2

```
Input: [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,2,1,2,1]
```

Note: 1. `1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000` 2. `1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`
